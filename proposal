##Major project cs30

my major project is going to be a minor little platforming game, which i've lovingly named The Long Way Forward!

 It features a deer-headed archivist of the high court, Ibinyu, on his way to reclaim scrolls. 
 
 
 
 ##needs to have:
 - working platforms
 - scrolls to collect 
 
 
 ##nice to have:
 - accurate gravity
 - sidescrolling mechanic
 - npcs to talk to
 - maps/inventory
  - multiple areas
  - more complicated backgrounds
